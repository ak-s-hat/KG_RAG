            "Electronics 2023, 12, 2175 2 of 19\nto realize the dynamic balance between power generation and charge change, researchers\nmostly study the power load based on the time series [3] for power load forecasting. Until\nnow, there have been traditional models [ 4] and arti\ufb01cial intelligence (AI) models [ 5]\nfor prediction.\nTraditional modeling is based on statistical analysis and has good interpretability. The\nautoregressive moving average model (ARMA) is a classical statistical modeling method [6].\nNowicka-Zagrajek et al. [7] applied the ARMA model to California\u2019s short-term power\nforecasting and achieved good results. However, ARMA is only suitable for stationary\nstochastic processes [ 7]. Most sequences in nature are non-stationary. Therefore, the\nresearchers proposed an autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model [8],\nwhich converts non-stationary sequences into stationary sequences based on differential\noperations. Valipour et al. [ 9] used the ARIMA model to predict the monthly in\ufb02ow of\nDeziba Reservoir, and the prediction results are better than ARMA model. In addition,\ntraditional modeling can achieve good results in solving linear problems [10], but it cannot\nsolve nonlinear problems well and cannot deal with multivariate time series problems.\nAI modeling is data-driven, which has been widely used in power load forecasting,\nsuch as back propagation (BP) [11] and arti\ufb01cial neural network (ANN) [12]. In general,\npower load forecasting needs to be abstracted into time series forecasting, while traditional\nBP neural networks cannot deal with time series problems well. A.S. Carpinteiro et al. [13]\nproposed the use of ANN models to make long-term predictions of future power loads\nusing data obtained from North American Electric Power Corporation. The recurrent neural\nnetwork (RNN) is a special kind of ANN [14], which retains a small amount of previous\ninformation through a self-connected structure, so as to establish the relationship between\nthe past and the present. Tomonobu et al. [15] applied RNNs to long-term forecasting of\nwind power generation. This model is more accurate than the feed-forward neural",
            "Electronics 2023, 12, 2175 3 of 19\nterm power forecasting (LTLF) [ 23]. LTLF allows people to \ufb01nd and evaluate suitable\nphotovoltaic power generation locations on a large scale. In the above papers, the authors\nfound that the ensemble learning model has better performance after comparing the effects\nof the ensemble model and the single model. In addition, economic, environmental, and\nother factors also affect the consumption of power load [ 24]. Fan et al. enhanced the\nprecision of power load by adding weather multivariate variables [25]. It can be seen that\nmultivariate prediction has improved power prediction.\n1.2. Reasearch Gap\nThrough the background investigation of Section 1.1, the advantages of the traditional\nmodel are simple and interpretable. However, the performance on nonlinear and non-\nstationary sequences is not ideal. Even if the ARIMA model enhances the ability to solve\nnon-stationary sequences, it still does not have the ability to solve nonlinear sequences\nwell. Although the ARIMA model can solve the non-stationary problem, its parameters are\ndif\ufb01cult to adjust. At the same time, traditional algorithms cannot handle multivariate time\nseries problems. In AI modeling, the BP neural network [26] model cannot capture time\ndomain information. The RNN [27] model can capture time-domain information, but due\nto the problem of gradient vanishing and gradient exploding, the RNN model does not\nperform well in long-term prediction. The LSTM model alleviates the problem of gradient\nvanishing and gradient exploding to a certain extent by adding gating units, and has the\nability of long-term prediction, but there are also large errors. The Attention mechanism\nsolves the long-term dependence of input and output by calculating the correlation of all\ndata and has good long-term prediction ability. However, it is not sensitive to short-term\nsequence features, resulting in large errors in the \ufb01nal results.\nIn summary, a single model always has its limitations, and the ensemble models\ncan compensate for the shortcomings of a single model by integrating the advantages\nof multiple individuals. In previous studies, most of the work focused on the use of a\nsingle model for tuning and failed to combine the advantages of each model to improve\nperformance.",

            "STM-Informer model can not only capture short-term time\ncorrelation but can also accurately predict long-term power load. In this paper, a one-year dataset of\nthe distribution network in the city of Tetouan in northern Morocco was used for experiments, and\nthe mean square error (MSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) were used as evaluation criteria. The\nlong-term prediction of this model is 0.58 and 0.38 higher than that of the lstm model based on MSE\nand MAE. The experimental results show that the LSTM-Informer model based on ensemble learning\nhas more advantages in long-term power load forecasting than the advanced baseline method.\nKeywords: ensemble learning; energy consumption forecasting; neural networks; long-term load\nforecasting\n1. Introduction\n1.1. Background and Literature Review\nIn 2021, the share of electricity in global \ufb01nal consumption increased by 0.2 points,\nreaching 20.4% [1]. Electricity consumption has been increasing in recent years. It can\nbe seen that electricity is becoming more and more important in our daily life. With the\nincreasing demand for electricity, the country needs to build more power stations to meet\nthe needs of human production. The purpose of the establishment of the national power\nsystem is to meet the power demand [ 2]. If there is no accurate prediction of long-term\npower load, it will lead to too many power generation facilities or insuf\ufb01cient power\ngeneration facilities. Excessive establishment of power generation facilities will lead to a\nwaste of electricity and affect economic decision-making. The lack of power generation\nfacilities is more serious, which may lead to insuf\ufb01cient power supply and affect people\u2019s\ndaily life. Nowadays, the main task of power companies is to predict the power load so\nas to adjust the power supply and study the expansion planning of power generation\nfacilities. This paper studies the long-term power forecasting, aiming to solve the problem\nof expansion planning and transformation of the power system.\nBecause the electric energy in the power grid system cannot easily be stored in large\nquantities and the power demand changes all the time, the power company needs the\nsystem to generate electricity and charge changes to achieve dynamic balance.

Comparison results of six long-term power load models via MSE and MAE metric.\nCombining the results of the two tables, we can conclude that the LSTM-Informer\nmodel has improved the performance of the base learner on the short-term dependence\nproblem. It has relatively good performance compared with other more advanced models\nwith similar architectures. On the issue of long-term dependence, in most cases, it is\nsuperior to other single models.
